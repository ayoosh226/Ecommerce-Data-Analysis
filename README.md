## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

* **Python** – Main programming language for data cleaning and transformation
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation, cleaning, and handling missing or inconsistent values
* **Regex (Regular Expressions)** – Extracting structured details (brand, model, processor, etc.) from messy text fields
* **NumPy** – Supporting data operations and handling numerical transformations
* **Google Colab** – Interactive development environment for building and testing the data pipeline

## 📌 What I Did in This Project

* 📥 **Imported raw smartphone data** scraped from E-commerce (containing unstructured and inconsistent information).
* 🧹 **Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset** by removing duplicates, handling missing values, fixing typos, and standardizing formats.
* 🔍 **Extracted key features using Regex**, such as:

  * **Brand** and **model name**
  * **Processor type** and **operating system**
  * **RAM** and **storage** details
  * **Price information**
* 🧪 **Handled irregularities** like inconsistent naming conventions, mixed data types, and noisy text.
* 📊 **Exported the cleaned dataset** (`output.csv`), ready for use in Power BI or other visualization/analysis tools.
* 🧠 Created a **reusable data cleaning pipeline** that can be adapted for other e-commerce datasets.
